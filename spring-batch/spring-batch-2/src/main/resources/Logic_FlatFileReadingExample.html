STEPS:

0. Use input file "shipped_orders.csv" containing orders for a company, with first row as column/header of data.

A. Order.java - new file -- A POJO class with members matching the headers in the "shipped_orders.csv, the list of orders. This class will hold the transient data after we read from CSV till it is written by ItemWriter. Generate getter/setters and toString methods.

B. OrderFieldSetMapper.java new file -- implements mapFieldSet of the interface FieldSetMapper using generic type "Order"
	override "mapFieldSet()" using read() methods from FieldSet parameter of mapFieldSet() method. Use the column names (csv header) form the token in tokenizer and assign to members of a new Order object and return the order object.

C. Changes to SpringBatch2Application.java -- 

1. Create an instance i.e. tokenizer ("DelimitedLineTokenizer" of generic type "Order")
	(a) set the names to column names from csv through a string array. Default delimiter is comma (can be changed through constructor parameter).

2. Create an instance of "DefaultLineMapper". 
	(a) set our tokenizer as the LineTokenizer of the line mapper. 
	(b)set our OrderFieldSetMapper as the fieldSetMapper of the lineMapper to get the Order object from the parsed data from csv
	/**
	 * FlatFIleItemREader uses lineMapper to parse the lines form csv file.
	 * ... parses the line using the tokenizer
	 * ... takes parsed tokens and map them to our Order POJO object.
	 * The tokenizer and fieldsetmapper combination gets an Order object from a row in csv.
	 */
3. Instantiate an object of type FlatFileItemReader (instead of SimpleItemReader)
	(a)set the resource the csv file to read from,
	(b)set lines to skip from top of the csv file and
	(c)set the line mapper
