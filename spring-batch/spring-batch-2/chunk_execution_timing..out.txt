Total time:,	Read/Write/Commit counts:

=============================
50 items with chunk size of 6

sequential
234, 50/50/9
241, 50/50/9
229, 50/50/9

taskExecutor:
314, 50/50/13
326, 50/50/13
319, 50/50/13

taskExecutor+throttleLimit(6)
368, 50/50/15
350, 50/50/15
350, 50/50/16

Total time: is printed on powershell console
READ_COUNT, WRITE_COUNT, COMMIT_COUNT are from the table "batch_step_execution"

Observations:
* While using taskExecutor noticed that same number was being read multiple times by different threads,
* All 6 threads (throttlelimit) were invoked only once, and later there were no multiple threads. (Were there locks due to reading of same item by multiple threads?)
